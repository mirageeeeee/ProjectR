# RPGMods
### Server Only Mod
Server only mod for RPG systems, which also includes ChatCommands with bug fixes.\
Read the changelog for extra details.
#### [Video Demo of Experience & Mastery](https://streamable.com/k2p3bm)

## Experience System
Disable the VRising Gear Level system and replace it with a traditional RPG experience system,\
complete with exp sharing between clan members or other players designated as allies.

## Mastery System
> ### Weapon Mastery
Mastering a weapon will now progressively give extra bonuses to the character's stats.\
Weapon mastery will increase when the weapon is used to kill a creature, and while in combat to a maximum of 60 seconds. (0.001%/Sec)\
Spell mastery can only increase and take effect when no weapon is equipped.
> ### Mastery Decay
When the vampire goes to sleep (offline), all their mastery will continuously decay per minute passed while offline.\
This decay will keep on counting even while the server is offline.

## HunterHunted System
A new system where every NPC you kill contributes to a heat system,\
if you kill too many NPCs from that faction, eventually your heat level will rise higher and higher.\

The higher your heat level is, a more difficult squad of ambushers will be sent by that faction to kill you.\
Heat level will eventually cooldown the longer you go without killing NPCs from that faction,\
space your kills so you don't get hunted by an extremely elite group of assassins.\

Otherwise, if you are dead for any reason at all, your heat/wanted level will reset back to anonymous.\
```
Note:
- Ambush may only occur when the player is in combat.
- All mobs spawned by this system is assigned to Faction_VampireHunters
```

## PvP System
Configurable PvP kill serverwide announcement.\
Kill/Death will also be recorded, and a ladder board for the Top 10 K/D on the server.
> ### Toggle PvP Commnd
If enabled, players can toggle their pvp status on/off via the pvp command.\
If their pvp status is off, they are excluded from all PvP damage.\
Your server must be configured as a PvP server for the toggle to work,\
players will otherwise never be able to do any pvp damage despite toggling pvp status to be on.

PvP toggle will be overridden by Hostility Mode if the honor system is active.
> ### Punishment System
Additionally, there's a punishment system which can be used to punish players who kill lower level players,\
which is configurable in the config.

The punishment system also has an anti-cheese built-in in case the server is not using the EXP system.\
Purposefully unequiping gear to appear as lower level to cheese the punishment system will not work.

Punishment will apply a debuff that reduces player combat efficiency.
* -25% Physical & spell power
* -15 Physical, spell, holy, and fire resistance
* Gear level down (Overridden by EXP system if active)
> ### Honor System
All vampires start with Neutral honor rank.\
Killing a vampire with a neutral or positive honor rank will deduct some honor points,\
while killing a vampire with a negative honor rank will reward the player with some honor points.\
Another way to gain honor is by grinding mobs. Each mob kill will give 1 honor point.\
There's a hard limit of 250p/hours gain to prevent grind.

The honor title is added as a prefix to the player's name.\
All chat commands which are included within RPGMods should still be used without the\
honor title prefix if a player name is required.\
Other stuff like whispering to other players does require the title prefix to be used.

Honor title prefix is not automatically updated for chat messages,\
everything else like building ownership and hovering player names are automatically updated.

For all the mechanics to work correctly, please set your server settings to:
- `Game Mode: PvP`
- `Castle Damage Mode: Always`
- `Player Damage Mode: Always`
#### Hostility Mode
`[ON] Aggressive`\
Can damage any player.\
No reputation loss will be given to the aggressor when killed.

`[OFF] Passive`\
Cannot damage other players with a positive reputation.
#### Castle Siege
`[ON] Sieging`\
Player castle(s) are now vulnerable, and can damage other sieging player castle(s).\
Aggressive state is enforced during siege time.\
Siege mode cannot be exited until a 3 hour window has passed since activation.\
Activating siege mode will also affect your allies.

`[OFF] Defensive`\
Exit castle siege mode.\
Castle(s) are now invulnerable.\
Player is able to enter passive state again.

`Global Siege`\
In global siege mode, all castles are vulnerable unless the player's honor bonus says otherwise.\
Player aggressive state is not enforced during global siege.
#### All Honor Titles
| Title | Requirement | Reward/Kill | Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Glorious | 10000 | -1000 | Castle(s) is permanently invulnerable. Bonus is negated if allied with Dreaded players. |
| Noble | 5000 | -500 | Castle(s) receive -50% reduced damage. Bonus is negated if allied with Dreaded players. |
| Virtuous | 1500 | -100 | +15% resource gathering. |
| Reputable | 500 | -50 | -25% durability loss. (Does not affect durability loss from combat.) |
| Neutral | 0 | -25 | No additional stats. |
| Suspicious | -1 | 0 | No additional stats. |
| Infamous | -1000 | 10 | Enforced aggressive state. |
| Villainous | -3000 | 50 | -20% damage taken from positive rep vampires. |
| Nefarious | -10000 | 100 | +20% damage dealt to positive rep vampires. |
| Dreaded | -20000 | 150 | Enforced castle siege participation |

## World Dynamics
Each factions in the world will continously gain strength for every in-game day cycle.\
Vampires will need to regularly cull these factions mobs to prevent or weaken the faction.\
For each mobs killed, the faction growth will be hampered, if enough are killed, the faction may even weaken.

Every faction strength gain and stat buff can be manually configured, by the server admin via config & json file.

<summary>Known Issues</summary>

### General
- Resetcooldown command does not refresh skills that has charges.
- Blood command cannot apply "fragile" blood type.

### Experience System
- Some blood buff give a gear level to the character, which would be fixed once they kill something or re-equip accessory.

### HunterHunted System
- There's no known issue yet. Heat level does get reset if you reload the plugin/restart server, this is an intended behaviour.

### PvP System
- Punishment debuff lower the player gear level, which will be overriden by the experience system if the exp system is active.
